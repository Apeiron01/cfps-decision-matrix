# Scope

## Research question
What CFPS/CFE reactor formats are reported in the open literature, and how do they compare quantitatively on yield, time, and practical deployment constraints for three decision scenarios?

## Locked scenarios
1. Speed-first (rapid prototyping)
2. Yield-first (high yield production)
3. Low-infrastructure-first (field-deployable / biosensing)

## Core criteria
- yield: quantitative yield normalized to `ug/mL` where possible
- time: total reaction time in hours
- complexity proxy: qualitative 1-5 scale per format_class (1 = low complexity)
- scalability proxy: qualitative 1-5 scale per format_class (5 = high scale potential)
- automation proxy: qualitative 1-5 scale per format_class (5 = high automation)

## Limitations
- No new experiments; analysis is literature-only.
- No paid APIs or external services.
- Results depend on reported metrics and units; some records may be non-convertible.
- The first iteration uses a dummy dataset to validate the pipeline.
